# async_websockets
(WIP) WebSocket server built on [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) - pending a new name

# Why?
Because Rust is fun! The Websocket protocol is relatively simple, but has some complexities (such as the HTTP Upgrade handshake) 
that make it interesting. Plus, tokio is brand-new and just begging to be used to write servers which are stupid-fast. 

# How do I run it?
You can't! This project is a work in progress, if and when it becomes usable as a RFC6455-compliant websocket server this README will be updated to include usage instructions.
